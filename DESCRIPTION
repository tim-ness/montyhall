Description: This package runs a simulation of the classic Monty Hall game. During that game, a contestant was presented with three doors.
		Behind two doors were goats, and behind the third was a car. The contestant chose one door, and then the host opened another
		door that revealed a goat. The contestant chose to stay with their original choice or move to the other unopened door, and kept
		what the door revealed. This simulation is to see if it is better to stay with the original door or switch.
